# CreditLend Passport - Cross-Chain DeFi Credit Protocol

**CreditLend Passport** is a revolutionary decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol that enables users to **deposit collateral on one blockchain and borrow stablecoins on another**, leveraging AI-driven credit scoring, dynamic DeFi Passport NFTs, and secure Web3 Civic authentication.

## üåü Features

- **Cross-Chain Lending:** Deposit tokens on one blockchain and borrow stablecoins on another seamlessly.
- **AI Credit Scoring:** Personalized credit scores generated from your DeFi activity using advanced AI models.
- **DeFi Passport NFT:** Dynamic NFTs that represent your creditworthiness and DeFi identity.
- **Multi-Chain Support:** Compatible with Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, and Optimism.
- **Secure Messaging:** Powered by Chainlink CCIP for reliable and secure cross-chain communication.
- **Real-time Data:** Utilizes Chainlink Price Feeds and Functions for accurate and up-to-date information.
- **Web3 Authentication:** Integration with Civic‚Äôs `@civic/auth-web3` for secure and seamless user sign-in/sign-out.
- **Protected Routes:** Access control ensures only authenticated users can access sensitive pages.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly UI with smooth Framer Motion animations.
- **Dynamic Navigation:** Multi-page navigation with active state highlighting for routes like `/dashboard`, `/deposit`, `/borrow`, `/passport`, and `/swap`.
- **3D Background & Effects:** Futuristic UI enhanced by a `CyberBackground` component and matrix rain visual effects.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contracts

- **MainRouter.sol** (Avalanche): Central coordinator managing all cross-chain operations.
- **Depositor.sol** (Source Chains): Handles collateral deposits.
- **Minter.sol** (Destination Chains): Manages minting and burning of DSC stablecoins.
- **DSC.sol:** Cross-chain stablecoin used for borrowing.
- **DeFiPassportNFT.sol:** Dynamic NFT representing user credit profiles.

### Frontend

- Built with **React + TypeScript** for a modern, type-safe web app.
- Styled using **Tailwind CSS** with cyberpunk-themed classes (`cyber-glass`, `neon-text`).
- Wallet integration via **Wagmi + RainbowKit**.
- Navigation handled by **React Router** with protected routes.
- Authentication powered by **Civic Auth** (`@civic/auth-web3`), featuring `SignInButton`, `SignOutButton`, and `UserButton`.
- UI animations with **Framer Motion** for smooth transitions.
- 3D visuals implemented using the `CyberBackground` component with particles, grids, and glowing effects.
- Loading states include 3D loading screens, spinners, and animated text to prevent race conditions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn package manager
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
- Civic Auth client ID for authentication

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>

  ```
- Adjust settings in `src/civic.ts` (endpoint, chain).
4. Update contract addresses in `src/config/contracts.ts`:
export const CONTRACTS = {
MAIN_ROUTER: "0x...", // Avalanche Fuji
DEPOSITORS: {
arbitrum: "0x...",
ethereum: "0x..."
},
MINTERS: {
polygon: "0x...",
optimism: "0x..."
}
};
